# Lunch choices

this is a ruby on rails app that lets me and any other people willing to put their lunch into the universe of randomness choose a lunch option in Chinatown.

Migrations I need:
- Restaurants - can have many Categories
- Categories - can have many Restaurants

Functionality:
The user presses a button and the system randomly selects a lunch Restaurant.
OR
The user selects Categories they want to filter, and the system makes a new list that randomly selects a Restaurant

This is just for fun, guys.
